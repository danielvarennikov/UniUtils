UNISHELL

A simple UNIX shell

The shell supports piping, I\O redirection and classic UNIX commands (and a few additional ones).

Special commands: 

1.#procs# -> running processes and their status.

2.#set# -> create a variable in the global enviorment($ before it to access it afterwards).

For example:

~home/dani: set x echo

~home/dani: $x dani

dani

3.#vars# -> Get the list of all our variables.
